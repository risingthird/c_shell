  Retrieving and changing terminal settings


       int tcgetattr(int fd, struct termios *termios_p);

       gets the parameters associated with the object referred by fd and stores
       them in the termios structure referenced by termios_p. 


       int tcsetattr(int fd, int optional_actions,
                     const struct termios *termios_p);

       gets the parameters associated with the object referred by fd and stores
       them in the termios structure referenced by termios_p.  

       optional_actions: TCSANOW  Make the change immediately. 
       					 TCSADRAIN Make the change after waiting until all queued output has been written.
       					 TCSAFLUSH This is like TCSADRAIN, but also discards any queued input. 
       					 TCSASOFT This is a flag bit that you can add to any of the above alternatives. 



       The termios structure
       Many of the functions described here have a termios_p argument that is a pointer to a
       termios structure.  This structure contains at least the following members:

           tcflag_t c_iflag;      /* input modes */
           tcflag_t c_oflag;      /* output modes */
           tcflag_t c_cflag;      /* control modes */
           tcflag_t c_lflag;      /* local modes */
           cc_t     c_cc[NCCS];   /* special characters */
